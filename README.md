LineBot API to send messages. Use to notify yourself when some script or CRON job has finished running. Or when a sale is made on your online store.

Make sure to configure env.json file (I did not use pydotenv because some of the environment variables have "=" in them) with access token and channel secret from line dashboard beforehand.
